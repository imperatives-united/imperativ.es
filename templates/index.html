            <h2>What is impertiv.es?</h2>
            <p><strong>Imperativ.es</strong> is a confederation
              (i.e. a united coallition) of special interest research
              groups who have grown tired of navigating political red
              tape and having people sign petitions when all we want
              is to make the world a better place for all
              humanity. While our individual constituents may only be
              invested in some subset of the imperatives we champion,
              we find strength in our collective numbers, in our
              ability to mobilize, help each other where possible,
              share resources, and enact lasting change. We operate
              primarily through Slack, with each imperative having its
              own channel, and occassionally we structure in-person
              meetings and decentralized online calls to share ideas,
              connections, and figure out next steps.

            <h2>How are imperatives choosen?</h2>
            <p>Imperatives was started by a group of people who shared
              the fundamental belief that, we can't do anything lasting
              if the human race becomes extinct or our planet is
              destroyed. This seemed natural as the first imperative on
              which to focus. In addition to being consequences being
              catastrophic, the imperative also has the quality that
              very few people oppose it, As we gain momentum the
              community will decide how new imperatives should be added
            </p>

            <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
            <p>Mek has a life goal of mapping educational knowledge so
            that anyone in the world can be empowered to teach
            themselves and secure a standard quality of life. But Mek
            realized he can't do this is the world comes to an
            end. Mek wants to know if global catastrophe is a serious
            concern which should also merit his attention, and if it
            is, Mek wants to know
            which <a href="#proximal-causes">proximal risk(s)</a> are
            the most likely and most damaging. He then wants to know
            how he personally can make direct, lasting impact without
            having to fight opposing interests, like battling
            bureaucratic red tape and political campaigning. He also
            wants to find a community of people who have expertise in
            this area who can mentor him and bring opportunities to
            the table.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Work on imperatives often get stopped in their tracks
            because they focus on <a href="#proximal-causes">proximal
            causes</a> which are often steeped in opposition. Our
            strategy is to ask
            the <a href="https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/">5-whys</a>
            until we arrive at the axiomatic root of the imperative;
            one which is uncontentiously recognized as a problem by
            all. From this axiomatic grounding, momentum can be gained
            and paths of least resistance can be followed to enact
            impacts and changes which have near unanymous support.

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>
              <a name="proximal-causes">proximal causes</a> (or
              proximal risks) are causes or risks which are intimately
              related to and possibly responsible for a deeper
              outcome. Global warming, for instance, might be
              considered as a proximal cause to global catastrophe.
