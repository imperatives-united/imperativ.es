          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>Take part in real, lasting impact and an unambiguously
          better world by focusing on <strong>imperative</strong>
          issues.</p>

          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p><strong>Imperatives</strong> is a united coallition of
            special interest groups who are sick of political red tape and
            only want to make the world a better place for all. While our
            constituents may only be invested in some of the imperatives
            we champion, we find strength in our collective strength to
            mobilize, help each other where possible, and enact lasting
            change. We operate primarily through Slack, with each
            imperative having its own channel, and occassionally structure
            in-person meetings and online calls to share ideas, share
            connections, and figure out next steps.
          </p>
          <h3>How are imperatives choosen?</h3>
          <p>Imperatives was started by a group of people who shared the
            fundamental belief that, we can't do anything lasting if the
            human race becomes extinct or our planet is destroyed. This
            seemed natural as the first imperative on which to focus. As
            we gain momentum the community will decide how new imperatives
            should be added
          </p>
